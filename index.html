        <p>
            This is a collection of html+css pages that I made to practice my css.
            These projects were made by following freeCodeCamp's excellent 
            <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design">
                Responsive Web Design course</a>.
            The Guided projects section contains projects that are
            provided in the curriculum to introduce various html+css
            concepts to learners.
            On the other hand, the certification projects sections
            contain projects that I've made to pass freeCodeCamp's
            rigorous user stories to get through their course.
